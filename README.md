Give me a star if this helps you.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `searching`: the folder contains `binary_search.py`, and `sequential_search.py` algorithms.
- `sorting`: the folder contains `bubble_sort.py`, `insertion_sort.py`, and `selection_sort.py` algorithms.
